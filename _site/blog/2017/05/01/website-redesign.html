		<p><em>Disclaimer: this is a living document</em></p>

<p>I finally had a chance to start a long-overdue personal website/blog/portfolio redesign. Since I became recently interested in UI design, I want to put in a good effort to build a page that represents me. Using this post, I hope that I could to justify a few of my design decisions. It&#39;s not going to be perfect, of course. But I guess I will use this opportunity to improve my skills.</p>

<h1>UI/UX</h1>

<p>I am currently trying to finalize the design, thus some of the UI components are still janky and would not work well in mobile. Once I get the design down, I will re-write the styling to make it more robust.</p>

<p>I will share my design process in the near future. So watch this space!</p>

<h1>Tech Stack</h1>

<p>Currently, this blog is generated by Jekyll, a static-site generator. The cool part about it is that Github Pages is built on Jekyll as well. However, I recently encountered Gatsby.js, which is a static-site generator written for React. I am still looking at it and deciding whether I should re-write my site using that. In the mean time, I am still developing this website in Jekyll.</p>
