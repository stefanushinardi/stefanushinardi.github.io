I was working with Mobile Sensing Lab under <a href="http://bayen.eecs.berkeley.edu/">Prof. Alexandre Bayen</a> on traffic assignment problem. Previously, I did my undergraduate study at University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign in Computer Science. </p>\n<p>My interests lie in many things. I like to play music, take photographs and thinker with computers. I do not believe in silos as I feel that the most interesting ideas come from intersections of multiple areas of knowledge. I think that we (homo sapiens) are all in a quest of understanding the world a little better than our ancestors, so why not collaborate?</p>\n<p>Iâ€™m happy to chat about any of my technical interests and likely many of yours, music, culture etc. Feel free to get in touch.
