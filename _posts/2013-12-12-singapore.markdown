In 2012, a good friend of mine introduced me to film photography after he got himself a Leica M3. Right after, I got myself a cheap-half-working Konica Hexar AF. To my surprise, this camera has a really nice 35mm lens, which people often compare to 35mm Summicron V4. To this date, this has been one of the most reliable cameras I have ever had.
